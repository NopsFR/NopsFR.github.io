## Overview

**Inertia** ("Game Marketplace") is a real storefront for selling time-limited game licenses/products: a static frontend, a Stripe-powered checkout flow, and — instead of a single backend framework — a small fleet of five purpose-built Discord bots (`sales`, `ticket`, `management`, `authing`, `vouches`) that turn store events into operational Discord activity.

This entry was previously described as a Next.js/Prisma SaaS marketplace. The real repository has no Next.js, no React, and no Prisma anywhere in it — it's a hand-rolled Node.js HTTP server (`server.js`, built directly on the `http` module, no Express) with MongoDB via Mongoose, corrected here.

## Real scope (from the repo)

- **`server.js`** — a Node.js server built directly on the core `http` module (deliberately no Express/Next.js), handling Stripe Checkout session creation and a signed `/api/stripe/webhook` endpoint
- **`bots/sales.js`** — posts real-time purchase embeds to a Discord `#sales` channel with order ID, price, duration, and customer info
- **`bots/ticket.js`, `bots/management.js`, `bots/authing.js`, `bots/vouches.js`** — support tickets, staff management, license activation, and customer vouches/reviews, each a separate `discord.js` bot process
- **`ecosystem.config.js`** — PM2 configuration running all five bots plus the web server as separate managed processes
- MongoDB (Mongoose) for orders, users, and vouches

## Portfolio Value

Demonstrates building a payment flow without leaning on a framework (raw HTTP server + signed webhook verification), and a multi-process architecture where Discord itself becomes the ops dashboard — sales, support, and moderation all surface as bot activity in specific channels.
