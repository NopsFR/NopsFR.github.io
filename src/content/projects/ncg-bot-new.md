## Overview

**NCG Discord Bot** is a Discord bot and companion web panel for managing a *Rust* (the video game) server and team, with full Rust+ companion-app integration. Users link their Steam-authenticated Rust+ account through a self-serve login page (`/pair` in Discord opens a private login link); the bot then registers Firebase Cloud Messaging push credentials and receives pairing notifications when the player pairs their server or smart devices in-game.

This entry was previously described in this portfolio as an economy/moderation bot with PostgreSQL — that didn't match the codebase. It's actually a Rust+ team-management integration on MongoDB, which is corrected here.

## Real scope (from the repo)

- Discord.js v14 slash commands, registered via a `deploy:commands` npm script
- Express-based web panel (`public/index.html`, `public/login.html`, `public/camera.html`) for Steam login and in-game smart camera/device control
- MongoDB + Mongoose for persistence
- FCM push via `@liamcottle/push-receiver` for real-time device pairing events
- `Jimp` for processing in-game smart camera frames
- Deployment configs for Docker, PM2 (`ecosystem.config.js`), Railway, and Render

## Portfolio Value

Demonstrates a real third-party API integration (Rust+ companion protocol), an OAuth-style account-linking flow, push notification handling, and shipping the same bot across multiple hosting targets.
