## Overview

**NEXUS Cyber Lab** is a desktop cybersecurity training simulator — an interactive classroom environment for teaching security concepts without touching real systems. Built with Tauri 2 and React on the desktop, and a Fastify + PostgreSQL backend.

This entry previously described NEXUS as "Docker/Kubernetes infrastructure with Kali Linux tools, Metasploit, and Burp Suite integration." That didn't match the real project — corrected here. The actual, and more interesting, design choice is explicit in the project's own README: *"All routes use fictional or documentation-only data and do not scan, exploit or capture external systems."* It's a safe, synthetic training tool, not a live pentesting platform.

## Real scope (from the repo)

- **Desktop shell**: Tauri 2 with a custom frameless title bar, 16 routed sidebar destinations
- **Simulated tooling**: 17 "safe tool profiles" with synthetic live output and defender-evidence displays — teaching what security tools *look like* in use, without executing anything against real infrastructure
- **World map**: a simulated global view built with `d3-geo`/`topojson-client`
- **Backend**: Fastify API with `@fastify/helmet`, `@fastify/rate-limit`, `@fastify/cors`, JWT auth via `jose`, Zod-validated inputs, PostgreSQL 17 (Docker Compose for local dev)
- **Accessibility**: five colour-accessibility modes, reduced-motion support, density controls, and interface labels in English/French/Spanish/German
- **Packaging**: Windows MSI and NSIS installers built via Tauri

## Portfolio Value

Demonstrates a deliberately safe approach to teaching offensive/defensive security concepts (synthetic data, no real scanning), paired with real desktop-app engineering (Tauri, native packaging) and a properly hardened Fastify API (rate limiting, security headers, JWT, validated input).

**Repository**: local project, not currently published to a public GitHub repository.
