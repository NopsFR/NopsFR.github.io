## Overview

**Cipher Protocol** ("Oscar Senior — Cipher Protocol") is the personal portfolio site itself — a React + Vite single-page app styled around a "Penetration Tester / Red Team Operator" identity, deployed on Vercel.

This entry was previously described as "three portfolio design iterations" with fake `v1`/`v2`/`v3` demo links (`portfolio-v1.example.com`, etc.) that don't resolve. It's actually one continuously-evolving project with real, verifiable history — corrected here to reflect that, with the real public GitHub repository.

## Real scope (from the repo)

- **32+ commits** of real iteration: hero section glow/letter-spacing fixes, responsive mobile pass, centered layout work, nav spacing
- A **TryHackMe badge gallery** with rarity filtering built directly into the site
- A private admin dashboard (`/Oscar.admin`) with analytics, user management, security, and config sections
- A personal bio page and a data-privacy page
- `@vercel/blob` serverless API routes (`api/upload.js`, `api/list-images.js`) for an admin media gallery
- Several real bug-fix commits around Vercel's SPA routing vs. framework auto-detection (`vercel.json` rewrites, `framework: vite` pinning)

## Portfolio Value

Demonstrates real iterative product/UX work on a live, shipped site — including the unglamorous parts (routing bugs, mobile responsiveness, deployment config) that don't show up in a feature list but are exactly what a working engineer deals with.
